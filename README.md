# upload-performance
 PUT a series of standard size files to exercise the SAFENetwork testnets
 
 To use this script you must have a local test network running. The script will preload the account with 10000 testcoins so very long runs should be feasible.

Usage:  random-files-upload-test.sh 100 15 30  will run the test with a filesize of 100k random bytes for 15 iterations with a delay of 30 seconds between each run.
